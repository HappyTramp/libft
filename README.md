# libft

The state of this repo when I pass can be checked with the [raw](http://github.com/HappyTramp/libft/tree/raw) tag.

I have both the pre 2019 and current functions. There is also my [get\_nex\_line](http://github.com/HappyTramp/get_next_line) in the mix.

The [rendu](http://github.com/HappyTramp/libft/tree/rendu) branch is the one I use for my other projects, it doesnt contain .gitignore, README.md and subjects.
