# libft [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/HappyTramp/libft.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/HappyTramp/libft)

libft is an extension/remake of the standard library.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/HappyTramp/libft libft
cd libft

```

This will produce a `libft.a` library which you can link to your project.

## Unit Test

```
make test
```

## Dependencies

* [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) - unit testing lib

## .libftignore

Much like the `.gitignore` file, you can put the files/directory to ignore when compiling.
